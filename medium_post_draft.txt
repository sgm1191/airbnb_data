# Not Everything is about Money, is it?

I was checcking GitHub survey data which was made to a ton of developers (professional and non-professional) and trying to hone my data scientist skills.

This dataset comprises 154 questions related to job, personal information, opinions about coding area and similar experiences.

The first thing to capture my attention was a column named Job Satisfaction. I have been in more jobs that I thought I would be in my professional career.
This was due to the lack of satisfaction or change or personal plans. There are things that I would have liked to be different.

Now I have the opportunity to analyse the response of other developers like me and see what they think.

## Time == Money
